    <p>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.&hellip;hey.&hellip;the good things don't always soften the bad things;
      but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
    <p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.</p>

    <p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Saving the world with meals on wheels. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I'm the Doctor. Well,
      they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
